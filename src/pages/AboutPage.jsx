        Our Story
        </h2>
        <p>
        Raise the Case was created to give a voice to those who feel unheard
        by traditional justice systems. Our mission is to crowdsource public
        insight, promote transparency, and bring attention to overlooked
        stories.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since launching, we've grown into a passionate community of
        truth-seekers, investigators, and everyday citizens who believe
        justice should be accessible to everyone.
        </p>

        Raise the Case acknowledges the Traditional Owners of the land on
        which we live, work, and gather. We pay our respects to Elders past
        and present, and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres
        Strait Islander peoples. 
        Colonisation was and is the single greatest injustice to humankind, sovereignty has never been ceded.
